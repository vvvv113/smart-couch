# smart-couch

This repository contains two versions of the application: 
1) a social network for athletes, where he can enter his workouts both manually and by synchronizing with the Strava application (keeping a sports diary), 
and 
2) a second version, which, based on the first, using a machine learning model, can predict and predict athlete fatigue after a particular workout and tell him whether to reduce or increase the load during training.

p.s. About the second version, watch the video in the "ML" folder.
